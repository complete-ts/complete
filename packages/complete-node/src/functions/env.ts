 * Helper function to get environment variables from a ".env" file that is located next to the
 * project's "package.json" file (i.e. at the root of the project repository) and inject them into
 * the `process.env` object.
 *
 * Typically, once you have used this function, you would validate the `process.env` object with a
 * Zod schema. This function contains logic to convert environment variables that are empty strings
 * to `undefined` so that Zod default values can work correctly.
 *
 * Under the hood, this uses the `dotenv` library to get the environment variables from the ".env"
 * file.
 *
 * @param importMetaDirname The value of `import.meta.dirname` (so that this function can find the
 *                          package root).
