# complete-tsconfig

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/complete-tsconfig.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/complete-tsconfig)

These are shared TypeScript configuration files that are intended to be used in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) projects.

Note that if you use these configs with `pnpm`, you must also install `@tsconfig/strictest`, since pnpm does not properly handle transitive dependencies. (You also must also install `@tsconfig/node-lts` if you are using the Node.js config.)
