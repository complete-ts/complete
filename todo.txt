- fix docs.ts script to only insert links inside the tags, similar to how plugin readme script does it

- removing deprecated eslint rule didn't trigger audit, so logic is bugged?

- abstract generation/linting logic for plugin into complete somehow (for eslint-plugin-isaacscript)

- edit README file for all projects to go to docs website
  - once done, update URL in "export const createRule"
- remove all TODO in ./scripts/lint.ts
- remove TODO in \packages\eslint-plugin-complete\README.md
- remove TODO in complete-lint/README.md
- fix TODO in "complete-common/README.md"

----------------------------------

waiting on replies:
- enable "import-x/no-rename-default" rule once this PR is accepted:
