- removing deprecated eslint rule didn't trigger audit, so logic is bugged?

- abstract generation/linting logic for plugin into complete somehow (for eslint-plugin-isaacscript)

- edit README file for all projects to go to docs website
  - once done, update URL in "export const createRule"
- uncomment docs stuff in "ci.yml"
- remove all TODO in ./scripts/lint.ts
- remove TODO in \packages\eslint-plugin-complete\README.md
- remove TODO in complete-lint/README.md
- fix TODO in "complete-common/README.md"

waiting on replies:
- migrate knip config to typescript: https://discord.com/channels/1143209786612125696/1281699259988574251/1281699259988574251
