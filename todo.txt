- fix TODO in "complete-common/README.md"
- lint package.json (maybe abstract/consolidate monorepo logic?)
- abstract generation/linting logic for plugin into complete somehow (for eslint-plugin-isaacscript)
- see followup on https://github.com/un-ts/eslint-plugin-import-x/pull/140
  (need to customize import-x config further)
